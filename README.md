# ASCII-Picture-Converter

Foobar is a Python library for dealing with word pluralization.

## Installation

To install on command line do ```wget https://github.com/tylerholmes/ASCII-Picture-Converter/blob/main/ascii.py```

## Usage

To use simply run the ascii.py file and in your IDE or command line and type in the path name of
the picture you would like to convert to ascii. On lines 5 and 8 of the ascii.py file there 
are two sets of ascii characters to use 12 or 70 characters simply remove or add a `#` to 
change the amount of ascii characters you would like to use. Personally 12 characters worked
better and you are able to see the picture more clearly.
